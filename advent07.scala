// This is a tough one, even though the solution was quite clear, had to suffer a lot to get to the point when it worked
// My key problems: 
// 1) didn't read collection part of documentation, hence took time to find out the way to use Map correctly
// 2) didn't consider at first that values need to be memoized, ended up with infinite loop
// 3) Didn't come up with case Array(a, "blah", b) expression, had to use quite verbose approach. Again, pattern matching is awesome!
// 4) Was running into problems with LSHIFT/RSHIFT Int, since my integer check was in the wrong place.

// construct dictionary of output: expression
val exprDict = input.map { line =>
  val temp = line.split(" -> ")
  (temp(1) -> temp(0))
}.toMap

// Memoize: when we reach repeated wires, it has to know the value of the repeated wire, otherwise we are in infinite loop
